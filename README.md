# **TypeScript REST API for Shop Application**

This application is a **TypeScript REST API** designed to service a **shop application**. It allows users to:

- **Sign up**
- **Login**
- **Create, view, update, and delete products**
- **Manage a shopping cart and place orders**

The application uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication and **Express-Validator** for input validation, ensuring that routes are **secure and data is validated**. All data is stored in a **SQLite3** database.

---

## **Project Structure**

The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern. It is divided into three main sections:

### **1. Auth Routes**

- Manage **user sign-up and login**.
- Secure routes with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
- Validate user input with **Express-Validator**.

### **2. Admin Routes**

- Allows users to **view their own products**.
- **Create new products**.
- **Update or delete** existing products.

### **3. Shop Routes**

- Allows users to **view all products** from all users.
- Users can **add/remove items from their cart**.
- Users can **place orders from their cart**.
